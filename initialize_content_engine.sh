## Tool

<CompoundInterestCalculator />

:::explain
The formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) lets you calculate the final amount from compound interest.
:::

:::learn
Compound interest grows faster than simple interest because you earn interest on interest.
:::

:::challenge
{
  "question": "What if interest compounds weekly instead of annually?",
  "answer": "You would increase n to 52 and recalculate."
}
